Here's how you can do it:

1. Remove the `podman` related packages:[For Podman related Issues]

   sudo yum remove podman-docker container-selinux containernetworking-plugins
   

2. Install Docker from the official Docker repository:

   sudo yum install -y yum-utils
   sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
   sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  

3. Start and enable Docker:

   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker

4. Verify that Docker is running:

   sudo systemctl status docker
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Install Docker Compose on your system using the following steps:

1. Download the Docker Compose binary:

   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


2. Apply executable permissions to the downloaded binary:

   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


3. Verify that Docker Compose is installed and working:

   docker-compose --version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes even after installation of Docker Compose was successful, the `docker-compose` command might not be recognized. 
This could be due to the command not being in your system's PATH.

Try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. First, confirm the location of the `docker-compose` executable:

ls -l /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


2. If the above command displays the location correctly, you can add the directory to your PATH variable using the `export` command:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

3. After exporting the new PATH, try running the `docker-compose` command again:

docker-compose --version

--------------------------------------END-----------------------------------
